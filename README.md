ü§ñ Roboost - Enabling Development of Cost-Effective Companion Robots ü§ñ

Welcome to the Roboost repository! This repository is the central hub for the Roboost project. It contains the documentation and links to all other repositories that are part of the project. Originally named after my robot models (Roboost V1 and V2), I've expanded its scope. Roboost is now a collection of repositories that are intended to make the development of companion robots more accessible. The project is still in its early stages, but I'm working hard to make the dream of a useful and affordable companion robot a reality. If you're interested in the project, feel free to reach out to me via using the contact information on the projects [website](https://technologiehub.at/Roboost/).

Goals of the Roboost project:

- Minimize the development cost and time for companion robots
- Provide a modular software framework based on ROS2
  - Adaptable for different hardware setups
- Document the entire process of building a companion robot from the ground up
  - Including hardware, software, and integration with ROS2

Here is a little teaser of the Roboost-Mecanum robot with vector control. Documentation for this project can be found on the [project website](https://technologiehub.at/Roboost/) and soon in the docs folder of this repository.

## Getting Started

The Roboost project is a collection of multiple repositories, each handling a specific aspect of the robotic system. These repositories do not depend on each other and can be used independently. However, they are designed to work together seamlessly.

Each Roboost component mimics a brain region with a similar function. For instance, the low-level motor control component aligns with the Primary Motor Cortex in the brain. Just as this brain region handles executing motion commands from that are recceived from "higher-level" regions, this component manages the intricacies of motion execution. The following sections provide a brief overview of each repository and its purpose.

## Cerebrum

Link to repository: [Roboost Cerebrum](TODO)

üß† Cerebrum: High-Level Decision Making ü§ñ

The Cerebrum repository contains all ROS2 packages that are used to run the Roboost robotic system. It is the central hub of the entire software stack and responsible for all higher level features. The Cerebrum repository is the only repo that is deployed to the robot itself and not designed to run on an microcontroller, but rather on a board computer like a Radxa Rock 5B, Jetson Nano, or Raspberry Pi using Docker.

While it is currently in development, the Cerebrum repository will eventually handle the following tasks:

- Navigation
- Path Planning
- Obstacle Avoidance
- Object Detection
- Behavior Control
- ...

## Primary Motor Cortex

Link to repository: [Roboost Primary Motor Cortex](TODO)

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Primary Motor Cortex: Low-Level Motion Control ü§ñ

The Primary Motor Cortex contains code related to the motor control of the robotic system. It is based on a PlatformIO project for an ESP32 and listens to the /cmd_vel topic in the ROS network. The received messages then are converted into individual motor speeds which then are used to control the given motors using different motor drivers and control algorithms.

## Entorhinal Cortex

Link to repository: [Roboost Entorhinal Cortex](TODO)

üõ∞Ô∏è Entorhinal Cortex: Low-Level Sensor Data Processing ü§ñ

The Entorhinal Cortex is a PlatformIO project that contains the firmware for an ESP32. It is responsible for reading sensor-data (currently LiDAR, IMU and battery-level) and publishing it onto the corresponding ROS topics.
